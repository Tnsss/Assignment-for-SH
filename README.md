# Assigment-for-SH

Module_1
  In module_1 whose objective was to implement the Diffie-Hellmann key exchange protocol I used random public keys P and G 
and private keys a, b and it outputs them. Then it calculates the symmetric key and ouputs it too.
  Because my pc is low on performance I could not create a second Virtual Machine and establish 
communication between them, so I continued the calculations as if the module had access to both private keys without
each board sending them. 

Module_2
Unfortunatelly I could not complete the module to encrypt and decrypt a jpg in time.
